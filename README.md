# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
This project is the proof that I learned through week 11. This application must use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Also It has the DELETE route for deleting the data saved before.

## Usage
1. Open the Note Taker
2. Type a note title and the note’s text
3. Click the save icon in the navigation at the top of the page. And then they are saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes 
4. Click the delete icon next to the note's title saved. And then they are deleted from the left-hand column
5. Click the note title has saved in the left-hand column. And then the note title and the note’s text appears in the right-hand column
6. Click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page. And then the empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column appears
